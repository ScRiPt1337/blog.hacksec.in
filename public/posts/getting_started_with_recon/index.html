<h3 id="history-of-dorking">History of dorking</h3>
<p>Google dorking has been documented since the early 2000s.</p>
<p>Johnny Long,  was a pioneer of dorking. He first posted his definition of the newly coined term, google Dork, in 2002. Since then, its meaning has evolved to include other usages.</p>
<p>A dork refines that query, by combining technical and semantic elements, in order to take full advantage of the fact that web content is being constantly scanned and indexed by machines.</p>
<p>In a 2011  <strong><a href="http://www.techrepublic.com/blog/it-security/google-hacking-its-all-about-the-dorks/">interview</a></strong>, Johnny Long said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“In the years I’ve spent as a professional hacker, I’ve learned that the simplest approach is usually the best. As hackers, we tend to get down into the weeds, focusing on technology, not realising there may be non-technical methods at our disposal that work as well or better than their high-tech counterparts. I always kept an eye out for the simplest solution to advanced challenges.”</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="how-dorking-works">How dorking works</h3>
<p>In everyday use, search engines like Google, Bing, DuckDuckGo and Yahoo accept a search term (a word).
But most search engines are programmed to accept more advanced “filters” as well. A filter is a keyword or phrase that has particular meaning for the search engine. This includes terms like</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>cache</code>: this dork will show you the cached version of any website, e.g.  <code>cache:hacksec.in</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>allintext</code>: searches for specific text contained on any web page, e.g.  <code>allintext: hacking tools</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>allintitle</code>: exactly the same as allintext, but will show pages that contain titles with X characters, e.g.  <code>allintitle:&quot;Security Companies&quot;</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>allinurl</code>: it can be used to fetch results whose URL contains all the specified characters, e.g:  <code>allinurl: security</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>filetype</code>: used to search for any kind of file extensions, for example, if you want to search for pdf files you can use:  <code>email security filetype: pdf</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>inurl</code>: this is exactly the same as  <code>allinurl</code>, but it is only useful for one single keyword, e.g.  <code>inurl: security</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>intext</code>: useful to locate pages that contain certain characters or strings inside their text, e.g.  <code>intext:&quot;bug bounty&quot;</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>site</code>: will show you the full list of all indexed URLs for the specified domain and subdomain, e.g.  <code>site:hacksec.in</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>inanchor</code>: this is useful when you need to search for an exact anchor text used on any links, e.g.  <code>inanchor:&quot;cyber security&quot;</code></p>
</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="bigbountyrecon">BigBountyRecon</h3>
<p><a href="https://github.com/Viralmaniar/BigBountyRecon">BigBountyRecon</a> tool utilises 58 different techniques using various Google dorks and open source tools to expedite the process of initial reconnaissance on the target organisation. Reconnaissance is the most important step in any penetration testing or a bug hunting process. It provides an attacker with some preliminary knowledge on the target organisation. Furthermore, it will be useful to gain insights into what controls are in place as well as some rough estimations on the security maturity level of the target organisation.</p>
<p>This tool can be used in addition to your usual approach for bug hunting. The idea is to quickly check and gather information about your target organisation without investing time and remembering these syntaxes. In addition, it can help you define an approach towards finding some quick wins on the target.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Directory Listing: Finding open directories using Google Dork on your target organisation helps one to understand the directory structure on the webserver. It may reveal sensitive information or it may lead to information disclosure.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Configuration Files: Often times configuration files contains sensitive information such as hardcoded passwords, sensitive drive locations or API tokens which can help you gain privilege access to the internal resources.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Database Files: Database Files are data files that are used to store the contents of the database in a structured format into a file in separate tables and fields. Depending on the nature of the web application these files could provide access to sensitive information.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>WordPress: WordPress is an open-source CMS written in PHP. WordPress has thousands of plugins to build, customise and enhance the websites. There are numerous vulnerabilities in these plugins. Finding WordPress related</p>
</li>
